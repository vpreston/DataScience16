Assuming that bets are placed during the 30th week of pregnancy, what variables could you use to make the best prediction? You should limit yourself to variables that are known before the birth, and likely to be available to the people in the pool. "

I will say that none of these, without further investigation, would make a compelling case on their own, but together their might be something that can be predicted better than random guessing."
