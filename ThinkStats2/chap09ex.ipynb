One way to think about this is what additional topics would you want covered in the next class (or addressed in a followup e-mail to the class).

    "Statistical Significance is pretty interesting, but I wonder how scientists who observe phenomenon actually make compelling arguments/theorem based upon that as a metric. For example, we could claim that the relationship between ice cream sales and crime is statistically signicant, implying the relationship is \"more than just chance.\" Now, imagine a scientists who observes that the chemicl content of bubbles in hydrothermal vents is strongly correlated with the time of day that the sample was taken. We know that ice cream and crime is a silly relationship, but even experts in their field may not know that checmicl properties and time of day may not be related. \n",
